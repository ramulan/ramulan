1.	My idea in a nutshell
	
Creation of stores specialized in No Packaging inside existing supermarkets of the large-scale distribution. 
My project consists in the creation of specialized No Packaging stores inside companies of the large-scale distribution through the activation of a circuit where customers can indicate the No Packaging goods they wish to buy and the consequent organization of the storage and distribution of these goods by the companies through specific stores.

2.	Background
	
My project aims at partially solving the problem of the excessive production of waste caused by the enormous use of packaging in everyday consumer goods.
Every day we buy products packaged in materials that are not completely biodegradable, creating mountains of waste that cannot be eliminated. I believe that with small daily efforts each of us can improve the quality of our lives and the world we live in. 
My interest is in eco-sustainability and collective responsibility towards the environment.

3.	Data and AI techniques
	
Among the data related to the company, it will be necessary to define the list of goods in which it will be possible to apply No Packaging. For each of these goods, it will then be necessary to establish the storage, supply and logistics, as well as the deterioration time of each product.
Among the data related to the consumer, it will be necessary to design an application through which the consumer can indicate the quantity, type and collection times of each item of interest.
Through an AI system, it is then necessary to cross-reference the company's data with that of the consumer in order to initiate the distribution of goods.

4.	How it is used
	
The context of my project is large-scale distribution, within which to favor the creation of sectors specialized in No Packanging: CarrefourNOPACK, AuchanNOPACK, EsselungaNOPACK, etc..
Therefore, sensitize both companies and consumers, who are actively involved in the project.

5.	Challenges
	
The weak points of my project are various. Among these, there is definitely the fact that it cannot be applied to a large number of types of goods, but only to those with characteristics compatible with No Packaging.
Moreover, for the company, my project will require an increase in the number of employees and specific machinery for retail distribution.

6.	Whatâ€™s next
	
My project could expand considerably in various areas. From the legislative point of view, it could push the regulations of each State to make No Packaging mandatory on specific goods.  From a production point of view, it could lead to the technological development of new machinery and applications for the storage and distribution of goods. But, more importantly, it could establish a stronger collective awareness of environmental issues and address the protection of the planet as well as train and educate new generations through fun mechanisms of retail purchase. Buying the NoPack could become a game in which human relationships in buying and selling could play an important role. Finally, from a marketing point of view, NoPack could become a global brand.
